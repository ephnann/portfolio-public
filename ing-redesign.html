            <h5 class="section-head">User research</h5>
            <p class="body-full-w">As a user researcher, I wanted to understand how the experience of tracking and growing your savings with ING could be improved. I used qualitative and quantitative methodologies to answer the following research questions:</p>
            <p class="body-indent">1. How do users think and feel about managing their savings and expenses?
                <br>2. What methods, if any, do users use to track their savings?
                <br>3. How empowered do users feel to grow their savings?</p>
            <h5 class="section-head">Surveys</h5>
            <p class="body-half-w">I conducted a survey with 63 responses. The most important findings were that <strong>37.8% of young adults struggle to track and grow their savings</strong> and that overall <strong>73% of people try to  track their savings and budget</strong>. 
                <br><br>Furthermore, the main national Australian competitors for ING are Commonwealth Bank and ANZ.</p>

            2. I sometimes get frustrated how spending a little bit here and there adds up so quickly.<br>

            <h5 class="section-head">The problem</h5>
            <p class="body-full-w">Young adults try to budget but often struggle to manage and grow their savings effectively. While they try to stay on top of their spending, they do not want to miss out on having fun. They do not want to think very much about how they spend their money but hope to gain financial freedom one day.
            <br><br>How might we help users like Amy gain financial freedom while maintaining a healthy work life balance? What if ING Bank helped their customers create a budget and track their savings?</p>

            <p class="body-2" id="wire-caption">After researching different methods of data visualisation, I started sketching out ideas for a new dashboard.</p>

            <h5 class="section-head">User testing</h5>
            <p class="body-full-w">I tested the prototype with 5 users who fit the demographic of the persona. The main problem users encountered was understanding the graph in the middle of the screen. They also struggled to notice the account selection pills. To fix this, I made the following changes:</p>
            <ul class="body-indent">
                <li>Added coaching screens for the account selection and the graph.
                <li>Added a trend line to indicate how your savings are going.</li>
                <li>I made the graph end on today’s date to make it clear that this is savings over time.
            </ul>
            <p class="body-full-w">After these iterations, <strong>all users were successfull in completing all the tasks.</strong>
                <strong>3 out of 5 users said the new dashboard was ‘very intuitive’</strong>. 1 user said it was ‘intuitive’ and 1 user said it was ‘somewhat intuitive’.<br><br>
            <strong>All users said the new dashboard is ‘informative’</strong> or <strong>‘very informative’.</strong></p>

                <h5 class="section-head">Final thoughts</h5>
                <p class="body-full-w">This self projected redesign helped young adults visualise and manage their savings. The main limitation of the project were time and resources. The customer interviews and usability testing were insightful - however, if this was a real job, I would test with and interview ~20 users instead of 5. The prototype was focussed on understanding the data visualisations but was limited in its capacity to create new budgets. In the future, this part of the prototype should be expanded upon.<br>
